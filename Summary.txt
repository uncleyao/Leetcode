38,46,78: Use loop function

078 is generating set, so firt you need to sort, then there is no need to worry about set sequence

def generate_subsets(self, S, current, result):
        result.append(current)
        for ind, val in enumerate(S):
            self.generate_subsets(S[ind+1:], current+[val], result)
            
 046 is using sequence, and at first we shouldnt put [] in result
 
    def get_permute(self, seq, current, result):
        length = len(seq)
        if length==0:
            result.append(current)

        for ind, val in enumerate(seq):
            # try:
            self.get_permute(seq[:ind]+seq[ind+1:], current+[val], result)
